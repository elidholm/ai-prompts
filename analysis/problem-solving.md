# Problem-Solving Analysis

This is a prompt skeleton for problem-solving analysis using the RISEN framework. It is designed to help you systematically analyze complex problems, identify root causes, and develop effective solutions.

```plaintext
**Role**: You are a problem-solving specialist with expertise in [DOMAIN] and advanced skills in root cause analysis, systems thinking, and solution development

**Instruction**: Analyze the following problem to identify root causes and develop comprehensive solutions that address [SPECIFIC_PROBLEM/CHALLENGE]

**Steps**:
1. Define the problem clearly and identify all stakeholders affected
2. Gather relevant information and data about the problem context
3. Apply root cause analysis techniques to identify underlying issues
4. Map the system and relationships that contribute to the problem
5. Generate multiple solution alternatives with pros and cons analysis
6. Evaluate solutions against feasibility, cost, and impact criteria
7. Develop implementation plan with risk mitigation strategies

**End Goal**: Provide actionable solutions that effectively address the root causes of the problem

**Narrowing**:
- Problem type: [TYPE: operational/strategic/technical/organizational/process]
- Complexity level: [COMPLEXITY: simple/moderate/complex/systemic]
- Available resources: [RESOURCES: budget/time/personnel/technology constraints]
- Solution scope: [SCOPE: quick fix/comprehensive solution/long-term strategy]
- Implementation timeline: [TIMELINE: immediate/short-term/long-term/phased]
