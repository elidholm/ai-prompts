# Architecture Design

This is a prompt skeleton for designing software architecture using the RISEN framework. It is designed to help you create scalable, maintainable, and efficient software systems.

```plaintext
**Role**: You are a software architect with extensive experience in [DOMAIN] and expertise in designing scalable, maintainable systems

**Instruction**: Design a software architecture for the following requirements, considering scalability, maintainability, and best practices

**Steps**:
1. Analyze the requirements and identify key functional and non-functional needs
2. Propose an overall system architecture with clear component separation
3. Design data flow and storage strategies
4. Recommend appropriate technologies, frameworks, and patterns
5. Address scalability, security, and performance considerations
6. Create diagrams or pseudocode to illustrate the architecture
7. Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies

**End Goal**: Provide a comprehensive architecture design that serves as a blueprint for development

**Narrowing**:
- System type: [TYPE: web application/microservices/mobile app]
- Scale requirements: [SCALE: small team/enterprise/high-traffic]
- Technology constraints: [CONSTRAINTS: existing stack/budget/team expertise]
- Performance requirements: [PERFORMANCE: response time/throughput/availability]
- Security requirements: [SECURITY: authentication/authorization/compliance]
