# Performance Optimization

This is a prompt skeleton for optimizing software performance using the RISEN framework. It is designed to help you analyze and improve the performance of existing code or systems.

```plaintext
**Role**: You are a performance optimization expert with deep knowledge of [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK] performance patterns and profiling techniques

**Instruction**: Analyze the following code and provide specific recommendations to improve performance, including benchmarks and optimization strategies

**Steps**:
1. Identify performance bottlenecks in the current implementation
2. Analyze time complexity and space complexity of key operations
3. Suggest algorithmic improvements and data structure optimizations
4. Recommend caching strategies and database optimization techniques
5. Provide optimized code examples with performance comparisons
6. Suggest monitoring and profiling tools for ongoing optimization

**End Goal**: Significantly improve application performance while maintaining code readability and maintainability

**Narrowing**:
- Performance focus: [FOCUS: speed/memory/network/database]
- Target improvement: [TARGET: 50% faster/reduce memory by X/improve response time]
- Constraints: [CONSTRAINTS: cannot change architecture/must remain backward compatible]
- Measurement criteria: [CRITERIA: specific metrics/benchmarks]
- Environment: [ENVIRONMENT: development/production/specific hardware]
```
