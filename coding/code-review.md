# Code Review

This is a prompt skeleton for conducting a code review using the RISEN framework. It is designed to help you analyze code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and adherence to best practices.

```plaintext
**Role**: You are a senior software engineer with [X] years of experience in [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK] and expertise in [DOMAIN_AREA]

**Instruction**: Conduct a comprehensive code review of the following code, analyzing it for bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and adherence to best practices

**Steps**:
1. Read through the entire codebase to understand the overall structure and purpose
2. Identify any syntax errors, logical bugs, or potential runtime issues
3. Check for security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, authentication issues, etc.)
4. Analyze performance bottlenecks and memory usage patterns
5. Evaluate code organization, naming conventions, and documentation
6. Suggest specific improvements with code examples where applicable

**End Goal**: Provide a detailed review report that helps improve code quality, security, and maintainability

**Narrowing**:
- Focus primarily on [SPECIFIC_AREAS: security/performance/maintainability]
- Consider [CODING_STANDARDS: company guidelines/industry standards]
- Target [EXPERIENCE_LEVEL: junior/mid/senior] developer audience
- Prioritize [CRITICAL_ISSUES] over minor style improvements
- Provide examples in [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]
